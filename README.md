# Holiday Hack Day
Let's design for voice!

## Set-up
+ Make sure you have an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) account
+ Make sure you have an [Amazon Developer](https://developer.amazon.com/) account
+ Install the Alexa Skill Kit CLI: `npm install -g ask`

## Learning how to build a skill
For starters, I recommend following this [tutorial](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-city-guide/blob/master/step-by-step/1-voice-user-interface.md). It shows how to build a skill interface in the Amazon Developer console and then connect app logic to it from AWS Lambda. We'll walk through this tutorial together in the morning.

## Actually building a skill
### Node.js
+ The [`alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs`](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs) is probably the easiest way to get up and running. The README is quite thorough, and deployment to Lambda is made easy. Here are some sample skills created with this boilerplate:

+ [`skill-sample-nodejs-hello-world`](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-hello-world)
+ [`skill-sample-nodejs-highlowgame`](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-highlowgame)
+ [`skill-sample-nodejs-howto`](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto)
+ [`skill-sample-nodejs-trivia`](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia)

### Python
+ [`flask-ask`](https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask)
+ [`python-alexa`](https://github.com/nmyster/python-alexa)
+ Python 3.6 + Alexa [tutorial](https://medium.com/@jacquelinewilson/amazon-alexa-skill-recipe-1444e6ee45a6)
